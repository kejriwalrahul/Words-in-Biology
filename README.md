MDL based segmentation techniques applied to genetic sequences

## Word Segmentation

Approaches used:

1. Dynamic Programming based search optimizing Description Length Gain (as described in `Papers/DLG.pdf`)
2. Perturbative Search optimizing Description Length using Branching Entropy (as described in `Papers/BranchingEntropyAndMDL.pdf`)
3. Genetic Algorithms for Segmentation

## Protein Classification

Approaches used:

1. Dictionary based classification (as described in `dictionary_based.pdf`)
2. RNN based classification
