MDL based segmentation techniques applied to genetic sequences

Segmentation
    MDL Based Approaches
        MDL Gain based segmentation + MDL
        Branch Entropy based segmentation + MDL
    Non-MDL Based Approaches
        All 1/2/3/4 size substrings and top 100
Classification
    LSTM
    Hierarchical Cluster on MDL based similarity and use brown prefix
    BoW
    Language Model based Prob
